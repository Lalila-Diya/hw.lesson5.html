<p class="e1"><img id="l" src="pav.jpeg" style="width:100px;height:100;">Pav bhaji, a popular Indian street food, is a flavorful and satisfying dish consisting of a spiced mashed vegetable
gravy (bhaji) served with soft bread rolls (pav) toasted in butter. Originating in Mumbai, it was created to provide a
quick and filling meal for textile mill workers. The bhaji typically includes potatoes, onions, tomatoes, peas, and
capsicum, cooked with a blend of spices like pav bhaji masala. The bread, or pav, is lightly toasted with butter, adding
a rich, savory flavor. Pav bhaji is a beloved dish, enjoyed by people of all ages, and is a staple at food stalls and
restaurants across India.
